# bike_stores_dashboard

This project aims to provide an executive dashboard for bike store management to monitor their revenue performance. The dashboard provides insights on revenue per year, revenue per month, revenue per state, revenue by store, revenue by brand, revenue by category, top customers, and revenue per sales representative.

The dashboard is interactive and allows users to filter results by year and by state. It provides deep insights into revenue performance, allowing users to identify trends and patterns in revenue over time.

The dashboard was created using Tableau and the code is available in this repository. The code provides a reference for anyone looking to create their own executive dashboard for monitoring revenue performance.

This project is intended to help bike store management understand their revenue performance and make data-driven decisions to improve their business. The dashboard provides a clear visualization of the data and allows users to interact with the data to gain insights.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own data analysis projects.
